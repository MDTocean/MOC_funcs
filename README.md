# MOC_funcs
Some functions for calculating the Meridional Overturning Streamfunction in GFDL models, as well as heat transport. It can calculate depth- and density- space MOC: 1) along a specified cross-section using online output; 2) for a range of latitudes and ocean basins using online output ...; 3) and using offline output, calculated using z-space data. 

See the README in my SigmaZ_funcs repository for some notes on the types of input used in this package. 
Also read the header information within the package itself.
